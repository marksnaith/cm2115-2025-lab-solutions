# CM2115 2025/26 Lab Solutions

## Introduction

This repo will, as the weeks go on, contain the solutions to the **standalone** lab exercises for CM2115 - that is, the exercises for each topic that aren't connected to the weekly project.

The solutions for each lab will be added a week after the relevant class, to give you time to work on the exercises yourself.

## Repo structure

The repo is structured as a single .NET solution, with individual projects for each week:

```
cm2115-2025-lab-solutions
|   README.md
|-- Lab01
|   |
|   |-- Program.cs
|-- Lab02
|   |
|   |--Program.cs
```

## Using the repo

You can clone this repo, or simply view the code on GitHub. Cloning will allow you to modify the code with your own updates, but you won't be able to push these updates - to do that, you'll need to make a fork into your on GitHub account.

Either way, you can then recieve updates each week by either pulling (if you clone) or syncing upstream changes (if you fork).
